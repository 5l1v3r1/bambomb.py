BAM file fuzzer

This tool allows you to make BAM files which may or may not have unexpected conequences for programs that do not handle gzipped data properly. Was used recently to find a DoS bug in samtools, and several unhandled exceptions in Picard, but nothing to write home about.

It's not really a serious project worthy of a tutorial or readme, but if you have questions please ask
